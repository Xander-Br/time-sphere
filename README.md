# Time-Sphere

The goal of the project is to be able to leave time capsules at a precise location via the geographic coordinates of our web page.
There is the possibility to open a map where we can see the time capsules near us. We can also create a new one by putting a date of opening, some text and a picture.

You can open the time capsule and see the picture and the text using the AR technologie.

New features are planned soon.
